//! # Proof of Liabilities protocol implemented in Rust
//!
//! Implementation of the DAPOL+ protocol introduced in the "Generalized Proof of Liabilities" by Yan Ji and Konstantinos Chalkias ACM CCS 2021 paper, available [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1350)
//!
//! See the [top-level doc for the project](https://hackmd.io/p0dy3R0RS5qpm3sX-_zreA) if you would like to know more about Proof of Liabilities.
//!
//! ## What is contained in this code
//!
//! This library offers an efficient build algorithm for constructing a binary Merkle Sum Tree representing the liabilities of an organization. Efficiency is achieved through parallelization. Details on the algorithm used can be found in [the multi-threaded builder file](https://github.com/silversixpence-crypto/dapol/blob/main/src/binary_tree/tree_builder/multi_threaded.rs).
//!
//! The paper describes a few different accumulator variants. The Sparse Merkle Sum Tree is the DAPOL+ accumulator, but there are a few different axes of variation, such as how the list of entities is embedded within the tree. The 4 accumulator variants are simply slightly different versions of the Sparse Merkle Sum Tree. Only the Non-Deterministic Mapping Sparse Merkle Tree variant has been implemented so far.
//!
//! The code offers inclusion proof generation & verification using the Bulletproofs protocol for the range proofs.
//!
//! ## Still to be done
//!
//! This project is currently still a work in progress, but is ready for
//! use as is. The code has _not_ been audited yet (as of Nov 2023). Progress can be tracked [here](https://github.com/silversixpence-crypto/dapol/issues/91).
//!
//! A Rust crate has not been released yet, progress can be tracked [here](https://github.com/silversixpence-crypto/dapol/issues/13).
//!
//! A spec for this code still needs to be [written](https://github.com/silversixpence-crypto/dapol/issues/17).
//!
//! A fuzzing technique should be used for the unit [tests](https://github.com/silversixpence-crypto/dapol/issues/46).
//!
//! Performance can be [improved](https://github.com/silversixpence-crypto/dapol/issues/44).
//!
//! Alternate accumulators mentioned in the paper should be built:
//! - [Deterministic mapping SMT](https://github.com/silversixpence-crypto/dapol/issues/9)
//! - [ORAM-based SMT](https://github.com/silversixpence-crypto/dapol/issues/8)
//! - [Hierarchical SMTs](https://github.com/silversixpence-crypto/dapol/issues/7)
//!
//! Other than the above there are a few minor tasks to do, each of which has an issue for tracking.
//!
//! ## How this code can be used
//!
//! There is both a Rust API and a CLI. Details for the API can be found below, and details for the CLI can be found [here](https://github.com/silversixpence-crypto/dapol#cli).
//!
//! ### Rust API
//!
//! The library has not been released as a crate yet (as of Nov 2023) but the API has the following capabilities:
//! - build a tree using the builder pattern or a configuration file
//! - generate inclusion proofs from a list of entity IDs (tree required)
//! - verify an inclusion proof using a root hash (no tree required)
//!
//! ```
