used to determine the upper bound for the range proof, which is set to `2^upper_bound_bit_length` i.e. the range proof shows `0 <= liability <= 2^upper_bound_bit_length` for some liability. The type is set to `u8` because we are not expected to require bounds higher than $2^256$. Note that if the value is set to anything other than 8, 16, 32 or 64 the Bulletproofs code will return an Err.
